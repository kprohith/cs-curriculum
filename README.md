| Subject                        | Why study?                                                                                                                                       | Book                                                                                                                            | Videos                                                                                                                                                                 | Done? |

| Programming                    | Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion.                                                                       | [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) | [Brian Harvey’s Berkeley CS 61A](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter)                                                   |       |
| Computer Architecture          | If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.                  | [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html)                                            | [Berkeley CS 61C](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/                                                                                                           |       |
| Algorithms and Data Structures | If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve challenging problems. | [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://smile.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/)                    | [Steven Skiena’s lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2bFN3MyNDA&list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX32N0fVIyvn7ipWKNGmwpp)                                                        |       |
| Math for CS                    | CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.                                        | [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf)                                        | [Tom Leighton’s MIT 6.042J](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/) |       |
| Operating Systems              | Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.                                                 | [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)                                                  | [Berkeley CS 162](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRdybCcWDFzCag9A0h1m9QYaujD0xefgM)                                                                            |       |
| Computer Networking            | The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential.                                                  | [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://smile.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149/)   | [Stanford CS 144](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvFG2xYBrYAQCyz4Wx3NPoYJOFjvU7g2Z)                                                                            |       |
| Databases                      | Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work.                                        | [Readings in Database Systems](http://www.redbook.io/)                                                                          | [Joe Hellerstein’s Berkeley CS 186](https://www.youtube.com/user/CS186Berkeley/videos)                                                                                 |       |
